# SignupPlugin 2.0
Wordpress Integration for EXPA & Podio

## Overview
_Note: This project is intended for internal AIESEC use only. Hence, this project may reference some jargon from within the organization._

This Wordpress plugin is meant to be installed alongside a Podio workspace insfrastructure. It creates a lead on EXPA and Podio whenever an EP signs up on the form and makes it available for Wordpress embedding using the pre-defined commands in the _plugin.php_ file.

## History
This plugin was originally conceived as a script, gis_curl_registration (by Dan Laush), and later conceived for Wordpress as a plugin by Krzysztof Jackowski (krzysztof.jackowski@aiesec.net) and remixed by Enrique Su√°rez (enrique.suarez@aiesec.net) to fit AIESEC in Mexico's platforms reality.

## Dependencies
Dependencies are described in the _composer.json_ file and can be installed via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) using the commands:

```
composer install
```
